# Description of the work done
For analysis I chose TV series dataset that contains 158 Mb of data and stores nearly 225,000 IDs.
As an additional work I created a dashboard in Tableau representing the results from first 2 insights. By choosing a country, it represents 3 most popular shows and a pie chart with the distribution of genres in this country.
